## Description:
This program will allow you to specify how many players your game has,and for each player what class they are.
<br>
So far the current supported classes are Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, and Monk. However, not all sub-classes 
supported (yet).
If a player picks a half-caster it is not yet implemented.
Player options  will display when you specify which player's turn it is.
## Roadmap
1. All full-caster/melee classes and subclasses.
2. Complete a full half-caster class.
3. Add half-caster classes to the program.
4. Various content-book adventurer classes.
5. A "home-brew" option to allow player to create their own class.
6. Create front-end / UI to run outside of Python.
